# [android-opencv-template](https://github.com/floatlearning/android-opencv-template)

An [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) template configured to use [OpenCV for Android](http://opencv.org/platforms/android.html).

While researching OpenCV integration in Android, we found that many of the tutorials in place refer to setting up the Eclipse environment. For those using Android Studio, we thought we'd share an project set up to use the OpenCV library, which was converted to use [Gradle](https://www.gradle.org/) build scripts.
